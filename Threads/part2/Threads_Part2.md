Modify the above program using the wait/notifyAll features. When a thread tries to contribute its results to the shared data, 
and if it is not this thread’s turn, it has to wait. When it is the thread’s turn, its contributing result is added to the shared results 
and all other threads are notified. Thread_a will be first, Thread_b will be second, and so on.
